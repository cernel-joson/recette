# **Project Vision: Recette**

*This document outlines the core mission, vision, and guiding principles for the Recette application.*

## **1.0 Core Mission**

Recette is a sophisticated mobile application designed to function as a comprehensive **"Kitchen Assistant."** Its primary goal is to help users navigate the complex and often conflicting dietary needs within a household by intelligently managing the entire lifecycle of foodâ€”from inventory and recipes to meal planning and leftovers.

The app's core purpose is to **reduce the daily cognitive load and stress** associated with answering the question, "what's for dinner?" by acting as a proactive, intelligent, and empathetic partner in the kitchen.

## **2.0 Guiding Principles**

* **User-Centric Design:** The app must be designed with a deep understanding of its target users, particularly those managing complex family dietary needs. It should feel like a helpful assistant, not a tedious administrative tool.
* **Frictionless Data Management:** The burden of data entry should be minimized. The app will use AI to automate tasks like inventory updates from photos or conversational commands, making the system feel like it magically maintains itself.
* **Proactive Assistance:** The app should move beyond being a reactive database. It should proactively offer suggestions, such as meal plans based on expiring food, to help users make better decisions with less effort.
* **Privacy and Control:** In a multi-user environment, data must be clearly demarcated as private, family-shared, or public, with security rules to enforce these boundaries.
