# Recette - An Intelligent Kitchen Assistant

*Last Updated: August 20, 2025*

## üöÄ Core Mission

Recette is a mobile application designed to function as a comprehensive **"Kitchen Assistant."** Its primary goal is to help users navigate the complex and often conflicting dietary needs within a household by intelligently managing the entire lifecycle of food‚Äîfrom inventory and recipes to meal planning.

The app's core purpose is to **reduce the daily cognitive load and stress** associated with answering the question, "what's for dinner?" by acting as a proactive, intelligent, and empathetic partner in the kitchen.

## ‚ú® Current Project Status

The project is a highly functional, single-user prototype. The core architecture is stable, and the codebase has been refactored into a clean, multi-file structure. A comprehensive suite of unit tests has been established for core models and services.

### Implemented Features & Phases:

* **Phase 1: Core Single-User Experience (‚úÖ Complete):** Includes a robust data model, duplicate detection, and recipe lineage (variations).
* **Phase 2: The Organizational Layer (‚úÖ Complete):** Features AI-powered tagging and a powerful search engine with a guided filter UI.
* **Phase 3: Advanced Intelligence & UI Refinement (üîÑ In Progress):** A multi-model AI backend is in place.
* **Phase 4: Foundational Architecture Overhaul (üîÑ In Progress):** The core asynchronous `JobManager` system has been implemented, making the app more responsive and ensuring AI-generated data is never lost.
* **MVPs Implemented:** Foundational versions of the **Inventory System**, **On-Demand Nutritional Analysis**, and **Context-Aware Meal Suggestions** are functional.
